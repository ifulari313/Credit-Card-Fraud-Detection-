# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-
Project -  Credit Card Fraud Detection ( Logistic Regression )

dataset is highly imbalanced,

# 0 means - normal transaction         - 
# 1 means - fraudulant transaction
0    284315
1       492


Under-Sampling method for imbalanced data
build a sample dataset containing similar distribution of normal transactions and fraudulent transactions
After sampling Nature of data is not changed   - it is good step to check whether we got a good or bad sample
